# JavaSpongify
Original Java implementation of spongify

This one is actually fairly simple and (knock on wood) should be pretty much impossible to break. Typing into the gui which appears will automatically transfer text into another box below. Users have the option of switching between two formats, every other letter being capitalized or 60% of letters being capitalized. The files total up to be very VERY large for this program due to the wav format, but I didn't want to remove them, the sentiment killed me :/
